In some cases model performance may be improved if we transform one or more features into a different representation to provide better information to the model , this is known as feature construction ."

For example launched.rolling('7d') creates a rolling window that contains all the data in the previous 7 days. The window contains the current record, so if we want to count all the previous projects but not the current one, we'll need to subtract 1."
